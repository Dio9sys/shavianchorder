# shavianchorder
Shavian keyboard layout for the CharaChorder


# Install instructions

## requirements
The Shavian layout was made using [Kalamine](https://github.com/OneDeadKey/kalamine).

To install this layout in X11, run the following command (requires root):
```
sudo env "PATH=$PATH" xkalamine install shavianchorder.toml
```

You can install the layout temporarily to try it out by running that command but without `sudo env "PATH=$PATH"` on the front.
